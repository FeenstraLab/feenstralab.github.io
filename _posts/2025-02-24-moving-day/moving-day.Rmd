Our research group has moved to the [Department of Congenital Disorders](https://en.ssi.dk/about-us/contact/departments/c/congenital-disorders) within Statens Serum Institut at the beginning of 2025. This move will strengthen â€˜omics-based epidemiological research in the [Early Life Health strategic research area of SSI](https://www.ssi.dk/om-ssi/maal-og-opgaver/forskningsstrategi). We are excited to be working closely with department head Mette Nyegaard and her team on research into pregnancy and childhood diseases ðŸ¤°ðŸŒ± At the same time, we are grateful for having been part of a unique environment at the Dept. of Epidemiology Research also at Statens Serum Institut with fantastic colleagues and projects throughout the years.
